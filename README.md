# Project Name: Eazitrans
## Project Inspiration: 
As you all discussed, it will be a Payment System to ease the use of cash in public transportation. The system will be QR based and the system will collect money based on the distance traveled b the passenger. In addition to that, the system will also be a solution to toll payments. Tolls will be unique to their Geo-location and it will be easy to track payments and even get some deductions for frequent use.
I hope this is not too far of from what you discussed. More feature can be added though as time goes but we had to submit at least a base idea.
